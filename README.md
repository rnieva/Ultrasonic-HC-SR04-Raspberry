# Ultrasonic-HC-SR04-Raspberry
(for Beginners and young children)
A easy Pyhton script to get the distance using the HC-SR04 sensor.

HC-SR04
Basically this sensor emit high frequency ultrasonic sound, and receive the ultrasonic noise reflected. Later the sensor control calculate he time difference between the signal being transmitted and received, with a math formule the user can get the distance between the sensor and the object.   

1- Connect the sensor to Raspberry Pi in GPIO pins
- GND to GPIO ground
- Echo to GPIO 7. Here we using a 1k resistor within Echo pin and GPIO 7.
- Trig to GPIO 25
- Vcc to GPIO 5v

*Important: donÂ´t mistake the GPIO pin numbers with physical numbers in the Raspberry

2- Steps in the Raspberry Pi
- sudo apt-get install python or python3
- sudo nando name_of_your_Pyhton_script.py
- Copy the code and save the changes
- python name_of_your_Pyhton_script.py
